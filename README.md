# Blockchain JumpStart

This is a repository for the materials used in the Blockchain JumpStart. 

#### Hands-on lab
The Blockchain JumpStart hands-on lab uses an Ethereum blockchain network deployed on Azure. With MetaMask (CHROME extension) an Ethereum vault and the Solidity Browser you will interact with the Ethereum network and Smart Contracts.

The [lab description](Tutorials/README.md) can be found here.


#### Exercises
To explore scenarios, use cases and envision next steps we supply some guidance and [templates](Templates/) here.

More information on blockchain and Azure blockchain as a Service

* __Watch the learning videos on Microsoft Virtual Academy__
There is a complete series of videos on how to build blockchain applications for Azure, see [https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/microsoft-blockchain-as-a-service-17104](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/microsoft-blockchain-as-a-service-17104). 

* __Deploy an Ethereum Consortium network on Azure__
Follow this tutorial [https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/ethereum-consortium-blockchain-network](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/ethereum-consortium-blockchain-network) to easily create a Ethereum Consortium Network on Azure, use the Chrome add-in MetaMask for interacting with the Blockchain and doing your first transactions and to deploy your first Smart Contract to the Blockchain. To access the Ethereum network with the Geth console see the attached document.

* __Explore all the different BaaS offerings__
There are many different Blockchain solutions available on Azure here [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/?term=blockchain](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/?term=blockchain) you can find all off them. You can easily deploy different Blockchain networks and tools on Azure Virtual Machines.

* __Learn the Solidity language and Code a Smart Contract__
To learn how you can program a Smart Contract and find the language constructs and commands read the documentation here https://solidity.readthedocs.io/(https://solidity.readthedocs.io/) . 

* __Try out the Visual Studio Code extension__
There is an extension for Visual Studio Code, [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity), that makes it easy to program Smart Contracts with syntax highlighting and to compile your Smart Contracts so you Have the bytecode and ABI needed to deploy the contract to the blockchain. You can download Visual Studio Code for Windows, Mac and Linux here [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

* __Build Dapps with Visual Studio__
If you use the Visual Studio IDE there is an extension, [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=blockchain&target=VS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=blockchain&target=VS), that gives you some template top build a Smart Contract and a Dapp   that easily integrates with Strato Blockchain, [https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/blockapps.strato-blockchain-lts-vm?tab=Overview](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/blockapps.strato-blockchain-lts-vm?tab=Overview), a private Ethereum network by BlockApps. The tutorials to gets started with BlockApps are here [http://developers.blockapps.net/dashboard/quick-starts](http://developers.blockapps.net/dashboard/quick-starts) .

* __Examine the Blockchain as a Service roadmap__
If you want to know more about Microsoftâ€™s roadmap for Blockchain as a Service read the Project Bletchley whitepaper, [https://github.com/Azure/azure-blockchain-projects/blob/master/bletchley/bletchley-whitepaper.md](https://github.com/Azure/azure-blockchain-projects/blob/master/bletchley/bletchley-whitepaper.md), and to understand what Cryplets are you can read [https://github.com/Azure/azure-blockchain-projects/blob/master/bletchley/CryptletsDeepDive.md](https://github.com/Azure/azure-blockchain-projects/blob/master/bletchley/CryptletsDeepDive.md)
