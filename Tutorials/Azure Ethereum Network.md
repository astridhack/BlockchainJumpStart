## Azure Ethereum Enterprise Consortium Network

One of the Azure Blockchain as a Service offerings is the Enterprise Ethereum Consortium Network. To deploy your own Ethereum network you can use [this](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/microsoft-azure-blockchain.azure-blockchain-service) walkthrough, you need an Azure subcription to do so, see [subscription options](#subscription) if you don't have a subscription yet.

### The JumpStart Azure Ethereum Enterprise Consortium Network
For the JumpStart day we have a blockchain network deployed that you can use, the [JumpStart](http://jumpstartblockchain.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/) Ethereum Consortium network. You can get a high-level overview of the topology deployed by reviewing the Ethereum Node Status on [this](http://jumpstartblockchain.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/) page. It shows all node hostnames and the participant to which the node belongs. It also displays node connectivity with the peer count. Peer count is the minimum of the number of mining nodes in the network.

The node status is refreshed every 10 seconds. Reload the page via the browser or "Reload" button to update the view.
