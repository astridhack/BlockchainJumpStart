The lab consist of the following steps:
1. [Connect to the Azure Ethereum Enterprise Consortium Network](Azure%20Ethereum%20Network/)
2. [Install MetaMask, create a blockchain account and intiate your account with some Ether](MetaMask%20and%20Accounts/)
3. [Use the Solidity browser to create, deploy and use a Smart Contract](SmartContracts%20with%20Solidity%20Browser/)

#### Azure Ethereum Blockchain Network
One of the Azure Blockchain as a Service offerings is the Enterprise Ethereum Consortium Network. To deploy your own Ethereum __development__ network you can use [this](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/microsoft-azure-blockchain.azure-blockchain-service) walkthrough. If you want to deploy a __multi member__ test Ethereum Network follow [this](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/multi-member-consortium-blockchain-networks-on-azure/) walkthrough.
You need an Azure subcription to do so, see [subscription options](Azure%20Subscription) if you don't have a subscription yet.
